# Forkify App Project

Forkify – The go-to search engine for recipes and ingredients.

[EN]: Dive into over 1,000,000 recipes and ingredients, learn how to cook them, tweak servings to match your needs, whip up your own custom recipes, and save your favorites so they’re always at hand!

Over the past year, I’ve been all in on JavaScript and just wrapped up an advanced course—this project is one of its highlights. While building it, I got my hands dirty with some key JavaScript concepts and tools:

1️⃣ ASYNC – This was my first time working with async functions to handle API promises and optimize how the app fetches data. Asynchronous JavaScript is a must for real-world projects that deal with APIs.

2️⃣ AJAX – This tech is a game-changer. It lets the app communicate with the server and fetch or send data without refreshing the page. The result? A smoother, faster, and more user-friendly experience.

3️⃣ OOP – Object-Oriented Programming was key in this project. It helped me organize features like recipe searches, serving adjustments, custom recipe creation, and bookmarks. Thanks to OOP, the code is way more structured, reusable, and easier to maintain.

Thank you for reading all the way through! Feel free to ask questions, give feedback, share compliments, or just reach out for a chat!
